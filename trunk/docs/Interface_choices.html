<p></p>OSWorkflow provides several implementations of the 
<b>com.opensymphony.workflow.Workflow</b> interface that can be used in your application.

<h3>BasicWorkflow
</h3>
<p></p>The BasicWorkflow has no transactional support, though depending upon your persistence implementation, transactional support can be wrapped around this. It is created by doing  
<div>
<pre>Workflow wf = 
<span>new</span> BasicWorkflow(username)</pre></div> where username is the user who is associated with the current request.

<h3>EJBWorkflow
</h3>
<p></p>The EJB workflow uses the EJB container to manage transactions. This is configured in 
<b>ejb-jar.xml</b>. It is created by doing 
<div>
<pre>Workflow wf = 
<span>new</span> EJBWorkflow()</pre></div>. There is no need to give the username (as in BasicWorkflow and OfbizWorkflow) since that is automatically pulled in from the EJB container once the user has been authorized.

<h3>OfbizWorkflow
</h3>
<p></p>The OfbizWorkflow is exactly like the BasicWorkflow in every way, except that methods that require transactional support are wrapped with ofbiz TransactionUtil calls.
