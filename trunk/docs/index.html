<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>OSWorkflow is very different from most other workflow systems available, both commercially and in the
open source world.
What makes OSWorkflow different is that it is extremely flexible.
</p>

<p>
This flexibility can be hard to grasp at first, however.
In fact, OSWorkflow does not contain graphical user interface components.
It is up to the application developer to provide this sort of integration,
as well as any integration with existing code and databases.
These may seem like problems to someone who is looking for a
quick "plug-and-play" workflow solution, but we've found that such
a solution never provides enough flexibility to properly fulfill
requirements in a full-blown application.
</p>

<p>
<b>OSWorkflow gives you this flexbility.</b>
