<h3>About</h3>
<p>
The OSWorkflow Designer is a Swing based GUI application to edit and manage workflows. It is currently
in an alpha stage, but is already fairly functional
</p>
<h3>Try It!</h3>
<p>
A webstart version of the designer is currently available. To launch it, <a href="designer.jnlp">click here</a>.
</p>
<h3>Workspace</h3>
<p>
Before you get to the fun of editing workflows, you will need to create a workspace. A workspace is simply
a convenient way of grouping together multiple workflows. To create a workflow, select <b>File -&gt; New
-&gt New workspace</b>. This will create a new unsaved workspaces, that you can import workflows into.
<p>
Before importing though, you need to save the workspace. Select <b>File -&gt; Save workspace</b>. You will
be prompted for a filename. Note that the designer will save all the project files alongside the workspace
file, so it is recommended that you create a new empty directory and save the workspace into it.
</p>
Now that your workspace is saved, you can import or create workflows. For a large collection of example
workflows to import, look in OSWorkflow's <code>src/test/samples</code> directory. You can download these
samples from <a href="https://osworkflow.dev.java.net/source/browse/osworkflow/src/test/samples/">here</a>
<p>
As noted earlier, the designer is an alpha release, so new features and fixes are happening daily. If you do find
any bugs or have any contributions you'd like to make, then please do not hesitate to file an issue
for it. Enjoy!
