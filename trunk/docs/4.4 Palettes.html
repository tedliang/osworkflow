<p>The designer is reasonably flexible in terms of allowing the deployer to specify the set of functions and conditions that are available to workflow editors.</p>

<p>A palette in designer terms is an xml file that consists of a number of conditions and functions that the user can choose from when creating a workflow. The palette defines the arguments that can be specified to a particular function or condition, as well as whether that argument is modifiable.</p>

<p>Note also that palettes are fully internationalized. All the strings are resource bundle keys. The actual text is specified in <b>palette.properties</b>.</p>

<p>There are a number of magic keys that are checked. For every function or condition name (for example, <b>check.status</b>), a .long key is used for its description (in our example, the key for description would be <b>check.status.long</b>).</p>

<p>For arguments, the naming convention for keys is &lt;element name&gt;.&lt;arg name&gt;. So for the check.status condition's status argument, the key in the properties file is <b>check.status.status</b>.</p>

<p>In all cases, if a particular key is not found, an appropriate fallback value is used (for example, the condition or arg name as listed in the xml file).</p>

<p>Currently the designer only supports one global palette. A default one with support for most of the built-in functions and conditions is shipped in the designer's META-INF directory. Deployers are encouraged to develop their own palettes for their functions and conditions.</p>
