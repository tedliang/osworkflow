The designer is reasonably flexible in terms of allowing the deployer to specify the set of functions and conditions that are available to workflow editors.<p class="paragraph">A palette in designer terms is an xml file that consists of a number of conditions and functions that the user can choose from when creating a workflow. The palette defines the arguments that can be specified to a particular function or condition, as well as whether that argument is modifiable.</p>Note also that palettes are fully internationalized. All the strings are resource bundle keys. The actual text is specified in <b class="strong">palette.properties</b>.<p class="paragraph">There are a number of magic keys that are checked. For every function or condition name (for example, <b class="strong">check.status</b>), a .long key is used for its description (in our example, the key for description would be <b class="strong">check.status.long</b>).</p>For arguments, the naming convention for keys is &lt;element name&gt;.&lt;arg name&gt;. So for the check.status condition&#039;s status argument, the key in the properties file is <b class="strong">check.status.status</b>.<p class="paragraph">In all cases, if a particular key is not found, an appropriate fallback value is used (for example, the condition or arg name as listed in the xml file).</p>Currently the designer only supports one global palette. A default one with support for most of the built-in functions and conditions is shipped in the designer&#039;s META-INF directory. Deployers are encouraged to develop their own palettes for their functions and conditions.
