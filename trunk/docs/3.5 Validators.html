<p>Just like <a href="3.4 Functions.html" title="3.4 Functions">3.4 Functions</a>, OSWorkflow allows for validators in three different forms: <b>Java-based</b>, <b>BeanShell</b>, and <b>BSF</b>. Java-based validators must implement the <b>com.opensymphony.workflow.Validator</b> interface (or in the case of <b>remote-ejb</b>'s, the <b>com.opensymphony.workflow.ValidatorRemote</b> interface). With Java-based validators, throwing an InvalidInputException is all that is needed to mark an input as invalid and stop the workflow action from occuring. </p>

<p>But in BeanShell and BSF, things are a little different, since exceptions thrown in the scripts can't propogate out to the Java runtime environment. To get around this, any value returned in a BeanShell or BSF script will be used as the error message(s). The logic is as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>If the value returned is an InvalidInputException object, that object is immediately thrown to the client</li>
	<li>If the value returned is a Map, that Map is used for the error/errorMessage pairs in the InvalidInputException</li>
	<li>If the value returned is a String[], the even numbers are used as keys, and the odd numbers are used as values to construct a Map that can then be used in the above case.</li>
	<li>Otherwise, the value is converted to a String and added as a generic error message.</li>
</ul>
