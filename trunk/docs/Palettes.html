</ul><p class="paragraph"></p>Given all the flexibility that OSWOrkflow provides, the designer is highly flexible in terms of allowing the deployer to specify the set of functions and conditions that is available.<p class="paragraph"></p>A palette in designer terms is an xml file that consists of a number of conditions and functions that the user can choose from when creating a workflow. The palette defines the arguments that can be specified to a particular function or condition, as well as whether that argument is modifiable.<p class="paragraph"></p>Note also that palettes are fully internationalized. All the strings are resource bundle keys. The actual text is specified in <b class="bold">palette.properties</b>.<p class="paragraph"></p>There are a number of magic keys that are checked. For every function or condition name (for example, <b class="bold">check.status</b>), a .long key is used for its description (in our example, the key for description would be <b class="bold">check.status.long</b>).<p class="paragraph"></p>For arguments, the naming convention for keys is &#60;element name&#62;.&#60;arg name&#62;. So for the check.status condition's status argument, the key in the properties file is <b class="bold">check.status.status</b>.<p class="paragraph"></p>In all cases, if a particular key is not found, an appropriate fallback value is used (for example, the condition or arg name as listed in the xml file).<p class="paragraph"></p>Currently the designer only supports one global palette. A default one with support for most of the built-in functions and conditions is shipped in the designer's META-INF directory. Deployers are encouraged to develop their own palettes for their functions and conditions.</body></html>
