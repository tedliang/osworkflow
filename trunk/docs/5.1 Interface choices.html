<p>OSWorkflow provides several implementations of the <b>com.opensymphony.workflow.Workflow</b> interface that can be used in your application.</p>

<h2><a name="5.1Interfacechoices-BasicWorkflow">BasicWorkflow</a></h2>

<p>The BasicWorkflow has no transactional support, though depending upon your persistence implementation, transactional support can be wrapped around this. It is created by doing  <div class="code"><div class="codeContent">
<pre class="code-java">Workflow wf = <span class="code-keyword">new</span> BasicWorkflow(username)</pre>
</div></div> where username is the user who is associated with the current request.</p>

<h2><a name="5.1Interfacechoices-EJBWorkflow">EJBWorkflow</a></h2>

<p>The EJB workflow uses the EJB container to manage transactions. This is configured in <b>ejb-jar.xml</b>. It is created by doing <div class="code"><div class="codeContent">
<pre class="code-java">Workflow wf = <span class="code-keyword">new</span> EJBWorkflow()</pre>
</div></div>. There is no need to give the username (as in BasicWorkflow and OfbizWorkflow) since that is automatically pulled in from the EJB container once the user has been authorized.</p>

<h2><a name="5.1Interfacechoices-OfbizWorkflow">OfbizWorkflow</a></h2>

<p>The OfbizWorkflow is exactly like the BasicWorkflow in every way, except that methods that require transactional support are wrapped with ofbiz TransactionUtil calls.</p>
