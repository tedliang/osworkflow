<h3 class="heading-1-1">Integration with OSCore
</h3><p class="paragraph"></p>OSWorkflow requires <span class="nobr"></img><a href="http://www.opensymphony.com/osuser">OSUser</a></span> and <span class="nobr"></img><a href="http://www.opensymphony.com/propertyset">PropertySet</a></span>, which both require <span class="nobr"></img><a href="http://www.opensymphony.com/oscore">OSCore</a></span>. Furthermore, OSWorkflow makes heavy usage of the many useful features in OSCore, and therefore OSCore version 2.0.1 or above is required to use OSWorkflow.
<h3 class="heading-1-1">Integration with PropertySet
</h3><p class="paragraph"></p>One of the key features in OSWorkflow is the ability to save small variables dynamically. This allows for a <a href="Functions.html">OSWorkflow Functions</a> function to take place on day 1 in the workflow lifecycle and store a piece of data in OSWorkflow. Then, many days later, when an action is executed in the workflow, that same data can be transparently pulled up and re-used in another function. This is a very powerful feature that when used properly can allow for highly customized, long-lived workflow behavior that persists even after server restarts.<p class="paragraph"></p>This is all possible by using the <span class="nobr"></img><a href="http://www.opensymphony.com/propertyset">PropertySet</a></span> module. What kinds of variable types you can dynamically store in the <b class="bold">variables</b> Map is totally up to the PropertySet implementation that is chosen by the <b class="bold">WorkflowStore</b> you have configured in <b class="bold">osworkflow.xml</b>. For example, if you choose the <b class="bold">JDBCWorkflowStore</b>, you must make sure that the jdbc propertyset is properly configured in <b class="bold">propertyset.xml</b>.<p class="paragraph"></p>
