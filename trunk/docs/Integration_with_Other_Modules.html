<h3>Integration with OSCore
</h3>
<p></p>OSWorkflow requires 
<span></img>
<a href="http://www.opensymphony.com/osuser">OSUser</a></span> and 
<span></img>
<a href="http://www.opensymphony.com/propertyset">PropertySet</a></span>, which both require 
<span></img>
<a href="http://www.opensymphony.com/oscore">OSCore</a></span>. Furthermore, OSWorkflow makes heavy usage of the many useful features in OSCore, and therefore OSCore version 2.0.1 or above is required to use OSWorkflow.

<h3>Integration with PropertySet
</h3>
<p></p>One of the key features in OSWorkflow is the ability to save small variables dynamically. This allows for a 
<a href="Functions.html">OSWorkflow Functions</a> function to take place on day 1 in the workflow lifecycle and store a piece of data in OSWorkflow. Then, many days later, when an action is executed in the workflow, that same data can be transparently pulled up and re-used in another function. This is a very powerful feature that when used properly can allow for highly customized, long-lived workflow behavior that persists even after server restarts.
<p></p>This is all possible by using the 
<span></img>
<a href="http://www.opensymphony.com/propertyset">PropertySet</a></span> module. What kinds of variable types you can dynamically store in the 
<b>variables</b> Map is totally up to the PropertySet implementation that is chosen by the 
<b>WorkflowStore</b> you have configured in 
<b>osworkflow.xml</b>. For example, if you choose the 
<b>JDBCWorkflowStore</b>, you must make sure that the jdbc propertyset is properly configured in 
<b>propertyset.xml</b>.
