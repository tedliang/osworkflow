<p></p>This is a very brief guide on how you can create a new workflow instance using the OSWorkflow Java APIs. First, the workflow definition file (in XML) must be created and defined using the 
<a href="Configuration.html">OSWorkflow Configuration</a>. Then your code must know what the 
<b>initialStep</b> value should be for initializing an instance. Before you can initialize a workflow you must 
<b>create</b> it so that you have an ID that can be referenced from now on in the API. The following code example illustrates this:
<p></p>

<div>
<pre>Workflow wf = 
<span>new</span> BasicWorkflow(username);
HashMap inputs = 
<span>new</span> HashMap();
inputs.put(
<span>"docTitle"</span>, request.getParameter(
<span>"title"</span>));
wf.initialize(
<span>"workflowName"</span>, 1, inputs);</pre></div>
<p></p>Note that usually, you would use a more appropriate Workflow implementation rather than BasicWorkflow. For example, EJBWorkflow or OfbizWorkflow. If you want to use a Workflow store that does not have a custom workflow context implementation (for example, JDBC, or Hibernate), then use BasicWorkflow. Contributions of WorkflowContexts for various stores are more than welcome!
