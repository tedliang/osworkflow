</ul>
<p></p>To get the latest version of OSWorkflow, we recommend that you download the source via CVS and compile using the 
<span></img>
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/index.html">Jakarta Ant</a></span> build script provided there. Compiling OSWorkflow from source is trivial with the following two ant targets:

<ul>

<li>
<b>jar</b> 
<i>(default)</i> - compiles the library 
<b>osworkflow.jar</b></li>

<li>
<b>example-war</b> - compiles and assembles 
<b>osworkflow-2.5.0-example.war</b>, which is configured to use memory persistence and should deploy without any configuration into most web containers.</li>

<li>
<b>example-ear</b> - compiled and assembles 
<b>osworkflow-2.5.0-example.ear</b>, which is a J2EE application that is configured to use osworkflow with the EJB persistence store. Some configuration of data sources is required, as well as a full J2EE application server.</li>
</ul>
