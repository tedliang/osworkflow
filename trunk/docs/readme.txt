A note about the OSWorkflow Graphical Designer:
We hadn't planned on a graphical designer until OSWorkflow 3.0,
but due to some hard work by some OSWorkflow end users (thanks
again Anil Patel!), we were able to have a semi-working graphical
designer for the 2.5.0 release. However, the designer is not yet
anywhere near production levels and should only be used as a 
preview of what is to come. It currently only works semi-reliably
for read-only mode. If you are going to use the designer, we
recommend you back up all your data first. Thanks!
