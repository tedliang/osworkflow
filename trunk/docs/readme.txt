A note about the OSWorkflow Graphical Designer:
We hadn't planned on a graphical designer until OSWorkflow 3.0,
but due to some hard work by some OSWorkflow end users, we were
able to have a semi-working graphical designer for the 2.5.0 release,
which has been improved significantly in 2.6.0 and 2.7.0

However, the designer is not yet 'production worthy' and should only
with the appropriate cautionary measures. It might chew up your data,
it might produce invalid descriptors, it might outright not work. We do
encourage you though to give it a shot, and provide us with feedback!

To run the designer, just run java -jar designer.jar
