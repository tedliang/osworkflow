<p></p>OSWorkflow comes with support for remote invocation using SOAP. This is accomplished using the Glue SOAP implementation from 
<span></img>
<a href="http://www.themindelectric.com/">TheMindElectric</a></span>. It has not been tested with any other SOAP implementations, but getting C# to integrate in with OSWorkflow should be a fairly trivial task. We hope to include C# sample code in the near future. 
<b>If you wish to use an alternate SOAP implementation, such as Apache Axis, you are free to write your own wrappers to speak with OSWorkflow -- it should be very simple. However, we recommend GLUE as your SOAP provider of choice.</b>
<p></p>GLUE does 
<b>not</b> come with OSWorkflow and must be downloaded separately from 
<span></img>
<a href="http://www.themindelectric.com/">TheMindElectric</a></span>. . GLUE is generally free for most usage. You can find the license agreement when you download GLUE. 
<b>Again, SOAP and Job Scheduling support will not be available if you do not download GLUE 2.1 or later and include GLUE-STD.jar in your classpath.</b>
<p></p>SOAP support is optional and can only be enabled by including the Glue servlet in your web application, as detailed in the GLUE documentation. SOAP support 
<b>must</b> be enabled for scheduled jobs to occur, using the Quartz job scheduler. Here is some example code that uses Glue to talk to OSWorkflow:
<p></p>
<div>
<pre>
<span>import</span> electric.util.Context;

<span>import</span> electric.registry.Registry;

<span>import</span> electric.registry.RegistryException;
<p></p>...
<p></p>Context context = 
<span>new</span> Context();
context.setProperty( 
<span>"authUser"</span>, username );
context.setProperty( 
<span>"authPassword"</span>, password );
Workflow wf = (Workflow) Registry.bind(
  
<span>"http://localhost/osworkflow/glue/oswf.wsdl"</span>, Workflow.class, context);</pre></div>
<p></p>From this point onward, you can use the Workflow interface just as you normally would.
