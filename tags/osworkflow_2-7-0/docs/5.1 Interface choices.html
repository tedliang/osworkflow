OSWorkflow provides several implementations of the <b class="strong">com.opensymphony.workflow.Workflow</b> interface that can be used in your application.<p class="paragraph"><h2 class="heading2"> BasicWorkflow</h2></p>The BasicWorkflow has no transactional support, though depending upon your persistence implementation, transactional support can be wrapped around this. It is created by doing  <div class="code"><pre>Workflow wf = <span class="java&#45;keyword">new</span> BasicWorkflow(username)</pre></div> where username is the user who is associated with the current request.<p class="paragraph"><h2 class="heading2"> EJBWorkflow</h2></p>The EJB workflow uses the EJB container to manage transactions. This is configured in <b class="strong">ejb-jar.xml</b>. It is created by doing <div class="code"><pre>Workflow wf = <span class="java&#45;keyword">new</span> EJBWorkflow()</pre></div>. There is no need to give the username (as in BasicWorkflow and OfbizWorkflow) since that is automatically pulled in from the EJB container once the user has been authorized.<p class="paragraph"><h2 class="heading2"> OfbizWorkflow</h2></p>The OfbizWorkflow is exactly like the BasicWorkflow in every way, except that methods that require transactional support are wrapped with ofbiz TransactionUtil calls.
